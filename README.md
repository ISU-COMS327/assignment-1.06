# Assignment 1.06: The Fog of War

## Description

In this project, we did some interfacing between C and C++. The work for doing
this is very tedious.

I talked to Professor Sheaffer about this project, and he told me to only
convert my Monster struct into a C++ object. He said that because I've written
my own code for the whole semester, that's all I had to do for the interfacing
in this project.

## Usage

Same usage as always:
`make`
`./generate_dungeon`
